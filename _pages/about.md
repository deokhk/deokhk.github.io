I am a Ph.D. student in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at POSTECH, South Korea, advised by Prof. Gary Geunbae Lee. My primary research interest lies in multilingual language processing, with a special focus on reasoning — particularly on building language models that can reason robustly across languages. More broadly, I am also interested in multilingual NLP, information retrieval, and code generation.

Previously, I completed my B.S.E. in Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH.
