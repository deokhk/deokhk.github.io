I'm a Ph.D. student in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) group, working with Prof. Gary Geunbae Lee at POSTECH, South Korea. My primary research interest lies in multilingual language processing, with a special focus on semantic parsing. I aim to expand semantic parsing systems across multiple languages while maintaining their reasoning capabilities.

Beyond semantic parsing, my research interests include multilingual NLP, question answering, and information retrieval. I am particularly fascinated by the challenges of enabling robust reasoning across diverse linguistic landscapes.

Previously, I completed my B.S.E. in Computer Science and Engineering at POSTECH.
